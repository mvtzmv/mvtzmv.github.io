                        <h3>Piper</h3>
                        <p>
                            I worked at a pet store for a bit, and customers knew we worked with local animal rescues. I was alone in the store on a Sunday morning and a man called saying he had found a very small kitten. The man brought her in wrapped in a towel, Piper was 1 week old or a bit more then. I scooped her up and she cuddled right up to my throat and started screaming. The man paid for her bottle and formula, as well as donating some towels for her to sleep in while I was at work. After eating a bit, she slept for a while until I finished my shift and cabbed home with her.
                            
                            I knew at that point I couldn't care for her properly, having a job and schedule, and she had a much better shot with a litter of kittens, or best case a foster mom. I got in touch with a rescue the store worked with, and by absolute chance they had a mother with 4 nursing kittens about Piper's age coming in from 6 hours away. Piper was introduced and the mother immediately adopted her! Latched well, momma cat peed her, and the kittens all fell asleep a few minutes after that.
                            
                            Fast forward to about 3 weeks ago, when Piper came home. She was nervous at first, but when she realized where she was the house was hers. She's about 10 weeks now, growing bigger every day. Her kill count so far is a pair of headphones, one flip flop, and a very nice attempt at a fly.</p>
